                Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of
                tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with
                some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass
                adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far
                down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple
                words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into
                the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                investment as is with other cryptocurrency project.
                <br />
                We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for
                the "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital
                currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to
                understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being
                the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this
                space a real look.

                There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer
                would not find home there. Like Kanye said, "Personalities would
                become the new currency, and services would be built on top of
                them". Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like
                something we hope he would say.

                Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but
                this time there would be no dead presidents on the money, there
                would people like you on the money, and you would own it because
                it would make the most sense in the world.</span
